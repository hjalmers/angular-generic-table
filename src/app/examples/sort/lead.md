# Sort

<p class="lead">Sorting is essential to any serious table and Generic Table is no exception as it takes sorting seriously:) Currently it has support for the following:</p>

* Enable/disable sorting for specific columns
* Set initial sort order
* Alter sort behavior (prevent table from being unsorted)
* Sort on multiple columns (hold `ctrl` or `cmd` to add column)
* Custom sort function (use your own logic for sorting)
